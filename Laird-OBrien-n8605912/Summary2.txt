 7: Jira Stories
 8: Development Branch
 9: C# Manager GUI
10: C# Manager Form


Artefacts Overview & Why they were Chosen:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
6: This artefact simply shows the blog entry that i contributed to the group blog,
for weeks 7 and 8 of the project. 

7: Three of us in the group created the Jira stories, simply so that it would be
much faster for us to get through all of the user stories (20+). The website was
down during the time that I was putting together these artefacts.

8: Zubair and myself were responsible for the git repository, including managing
the development branch, and anything else the group needed. For example: uploading
files when people didnt have access to the github client, or reverting back to a
previous version of certain files.

9: I was responsible for creating the Manager part of the programs GUI. This GUI
required the ability to: Search for staff, search for a property, allocate a
certain property to a specified staff member, change staff working hours, and 
change a property's rental status.

10: I was also responsible for creating the actual Manager part of the C# program.
This part needed to do all the things listed above in section 9), but due to time
constraints and other projects was not fully implemented correctly
